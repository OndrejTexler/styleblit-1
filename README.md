# StyleBlit: Fast Example-Based Stylization with Local Guidance

StyleBlit is an efficient example-based style transfer algorithm that can deliver high-quality stylized renderings in real-time on a single-core CPU. Our technique is especially suitable for style transfer applications that use local guidance - descriptive guiding channels containing large spatial variations. Local guidance encourages transfer of content from the source exemplar to the target image in a semantically meaningful way. Typical local guidance includes, e.g., normal values, texture coordinates or a displacement field. Contrary to previous style transfer techniques, our approach does not involve any computationally expensive optimization.
